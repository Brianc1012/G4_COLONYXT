Team Setup Guide (Windows + optional Linux/macOS)
================================================

This guide helps your teammate set up the project and the built‑in Assistant end‑to‑end.

1) Prerequisites
----------------
Windows 10/11 with XAMPP (PHP 7.4), or Linux/macOS with PHP 7.4+ and MySQL 5.7/8.0.

- Git
- PHP 7.4 with required extensions (see below)
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org/) in PATH
- Node.js LTS (18+) and npm
- Yarn (we install it below if missing)

php.ini requirements (enable and restart Apache/MySQL after changes):
    extension=curl
    extension=xml
    extension=zip
    extension=intl
    extension=gd   (or extension=gd2)
    extension=ldap
    extension=openssl

For XAMPP on Windows: Edit C:\xampp\php\php.ini, uncomment the above, then restart Apache from XAMPP Control Panel.


2) Clone the repository (Windows PowerShell)
-------------------------------------------
Open PowerShell and run:
    cd C:\xampp\htdocs
    git clone --branch joel https://github.com/Brianc1012/G4_COLONYXT.git colonyxt

Project path will be: C:\xampp\htdocs\colonyxt


3) Backend dependencies (Composer)
----------------------------------
Install PHP dependencies (from the project src/ directory):
    cd C:\xampp\htdocs\colonyxt\src
    composer install

If Composer isn’t recognized, install it and re-open the terminal.


4) Frontend dependencies (Yarn)
-------------------------------
Install and run the client (use dev while developing, or build for production):
    cd C:\xampp\htdocs\colonyxt\src\client
    npm install -g yarn
    yarn install
    yarn lint:fix
    yarn dev    (for development)

Alternatively, to build production assets:
    yarn build

Note: The Assistant chat UI is server-rendered and doesn’t require the dev server to be running, but other UI parts may.


5) Apache configuration (Windows/XAMPP)
---------------------------------------
- Ensure Apache is running and http://localhost/ serves C:\xampp\htdocs.
- Optional but recommended: enable mod_rewrite in Apache. In XAMPP, this is enabled by default; if disabled, enable it and restart Apache.


6) Writable directories and cache
---------------------------------
Windows: No extra steps usually needed.

Linux/macOS: Ensure the web user (www-data/apache/_www) can write to these paths:
    chmod -R 775 src/cache src/log lib/confs
    chown -R <web-user>:<web-group> src/cache src/log lib/confs

If you encounter stale templates/UI issues after pulling updates, clear the app cache by deleting the contents of src/cache/ then refresh the browser.


7) Run the Installer
--------------------
Open in your browser:
    http://localhost/colonyxt/installer

Use these example values (customize as needed):
    Database Host Name: localhost
    Database Host Port: 3306
    Database Name: orangehrm_db
    Previledged Database Username: root
    Previledged Database Password: (leave blank if none)

    OrangeHRM Database Username: Admin
    OrangeHRM Database Password: ColonyxtAdmin123.

    Organization Name: Colonyxt
    Country: Philippines
    Language: en_US
    Timezone Group: Asia
    Timezone: Asia/Manila

    Employee First Name: Dexter            // customizable
    Employee Last Name: Morgan             // customizable
    Email: bus.finance.15@gmail.com        // customizable
    Contact Number:                        // customizable
    System Admin Username: Admin
    System Admin Password: ColonyxtAdmin123.
    Register: no

After installation, log in at:
    http://localhost/colonyxt/web/index.php/auth/login


8) Verifying the Assistant
--------------------------
- Sign in as the system admin (or any user).
- Click the floating Assistant button (bottom-right). You should see an initial greeting if the chat is empty.
- Click “Clear” and confirm the greeting appears again right after clearing.
- Try sample queries:
    "What is my name?"
    "When is my birthday?"
    "Show my leave balance"
    "How many hours did I work this week?"

If any value isn’t defined for the user profile, the Assistant will say it’s not defined and tell you where to add it.


9) Troubleshooting
------------------
- Blank page or PHP errors: Re-check php.ini extensions and restart Apache.
- Composer autoload issues: Run "composer install" inside src/ and re-try.
- Frontend styling issues: If you changed client code, run "yarn dev" or "yarn build" in src/client.
- Assistant greeting not showing: Hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5). If still missing, delete contents of src/cache/ and refresh.
- Database connection errors in installer: Verify MySQL is running, port is 3306, and credentials are correct.
- 404s under /web/: Use the full path http://localhost/colonyxt/web/index.php/… or enable Apache mod_rewrite.


10) Notes
---------
- Do not commit lib/confs/Conf.php with live credentials.
- Keep PHP at 7.4 for compatibility with this build; newer versions may require code updates.
